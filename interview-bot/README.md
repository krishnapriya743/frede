## Overview
This project is an Interview Chatbot created using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and the Streamlit framework. The chatbot generates job-specific interview questions and evaluates the candidate's responses. This is achieved using a sequence of prompts that leverage the language model's capabilities in creating questions and evaluating responses.

## Technical Aspect
The Interview Chatbot project is primarily divided into two parts:

1. The generation of job-specific interview questions.
2. Evaluation of the candidate's responses to the questions.

Both tasks are accomplished using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. The project uses Streamlit to create a simple and user-friendly web interface for the chatbot.

## Installation

The installation steps are different for different OS.

### Linux:

```bash
python3.8 --version
apt install python3.8-venv
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your secret key>
streamlit run chatbot.py
```

### Windows:

```bash
python3.8 -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your secret key>
streamlit run chatbot.py
```

### Mac:

```bash
python3.8 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your secret key>
streamlit run chatbot.py
```

Remember to replace `<your secret key>` with your actual OpenAI API Key.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors while installing the dependencies from `requirements.txt`, try installing the packages individually using the following commands:

```bash
pip install openai
pip install streamlit
pip install streamlit-chat
```

Then, export your OpenAI API Key and run the chatbot:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your secret key>
streamlit run chatbot.py
```
Remember to replace `<your secret key>` with your actual OpenAI API Key.
